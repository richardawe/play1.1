## 🔄 Key Differences

### Play v1.0 (Offline-First)
- **Core Modules**: Chat, Documents, Tasks, Calendar
- **AI Features**: Ollama-powered AI assistance
- **No P2P**: Single-user focused
- **Dependencies**: Removed libp2p, P2P networking libraries
- **Components**: Removed P2P chat, network manager, federation
- **Services**: Removed P2P services, CRDT, presence

### Play v2.0 (P2P Collaborative)

## 🚀 Running Each Version

### Play v1.0
```bash
cd play1.0
./start.sh
# OR
npm install && npm run tauri:dev
```

### Play v2.0
```bash
cd play2.0
./start.sh
# OR
npm install && npm run tauri:dev
```

## 📋 What Was Moved/Modified

### Files Moved to Both Versions
- ✅ Core configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- ✅ Source code (src/, src-tauri/)
- ✅ Build scripts (scripts/)
- ✅ Shared documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, prd.md, etc.)

### Play v1.0 Specific Changes
- ❌ Removed `src/components/p2p/` directory
- ❌ Removed `src/components/federation/` directory
- ❌ Removed P2P-related Rust commands and services
- ❌ Removed libp2p dependencies from Cargo.toml
- ❌ Removed P2P dependencies from package.json
- ❌ Updated main.rs to exclude P2P services
- ❌ Updated App.tsx to remove P2P navigation
- ❌ Updated Sidebar.tsx to remove P2P menu items

### Play v2.0 Specific
- ✅ Kept all P2P components and services
- ✅ Full libp2p dependency stack
- ✅ P2P networking capabilities
- ✅ Collaborative features

### Documentation Organization
- **play1.0/docs/**: v1.0 release notes, changelogs, distribution guides
- **play2.0/docs/**: v2.0 features, P2P guides, integration reports
- **Both**: Shared architecture, setup, and testing documentation

## 🔧 Independence Verification

Each version can run completely independently:

1. **Separate Dependencies**: Each has its own package.json and Cargo.toml
2. **Isolated Source**: No shared code between versions
3. **Independent Builds**: Can be built and distributed separately
4. **Separate Documentation**: Version-specific guides and notes
5. **Startup Scripts**: Each version has its own startup script

## 📦 Building & Distribution

### Play v1.0
```bash
cd play1.0
npm run tauri:build
# Creates: Play-v1.0.0-macOS.dmg
```

### Play v2.0
```bash
cd play2.0
npm run tauri:build
# Creates: Play-v2.0-macOS.dmg
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Choose Play v1.0 When:
- You want a simple, offline workspace
- You don't need collaboration features
- You prefer minimal dependencies
- You want faster startup times
- You're working solo

### Choose Play v2.0 When:
- You need peer-to-peer collaboration
- You want real-time messaging
- You need file sharing between devices
- You want to experiment with P2P technology
- You're working in teams

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Both versions maintain the same privacy-first approach:
- ✅ 100% offline operation (after setup)
- ✅ Local AI processing
- ✅ Encrypted local storage
- ✅ No cloud dependencies
- ✅ No tracking or telemetry

Play v2.0 adds:
- ✅ End-to-end encrypted P2P communication
- ✅ No central servers
- ✅ Direct peer-to-peer connections

**Both versions are now ready for independent development, building, and distribution!** 🎉
