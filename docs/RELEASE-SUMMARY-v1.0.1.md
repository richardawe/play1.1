## 🆕 What's New

### 1. Clear Workspace Feature ✨

**The Problem:**
- Users had no way to reset their workspace
- Testing required deleting the entire database
- No way to start fresh without reinstalling

**The Solution:**
- Added "Clear All" button to all 4 modules
- Safe, two-step confirmation process
- Permanent deletion with clear warnings
- Individual module clearing (not all-or-nothing)

**Where:**
- 💬 **Chat**: Clear all messages (all channels)
- 📝 **Documents**: Clear all docs + version history
- ✅ **Tasks**: Clear all tasks (all statuses/priorities)
- 📅 **Calendar**: Clear all events

**UI/UX:**
- Red button with trash icon (destructive action indicator)
- Confirmation modal with warning
- "Cannot be undone" message
- Loading state during operation
- Instant UI refresh after clear

---

### 2. Ollama Port Fix 🔧

**The Problem:**
- App was hardcoded to port 8080
- Most users have Ollama on default port 11434
- App didn't detect existing Ollama installations

**The Solution:**
- Changed default port from 8080 → 11434
- Added fallback to port 8080 if needed
- Better port detection logic
- Checks both ports automatically

**Impact:**
- ✅ No setup screen for existing Ollama users
- ✅ Instant AI features (no extra configuration)
- ✅ Works with both standard and custom ports

---

## 🎯 User Benefits

### For End Users:
1. **Quick Reset**: Clear workspace during testing
2. **Fresh Start**: Start over without reinstalling
3. **Better Onboarding**: App detects Ollama automatically
4. **Faster Setup**: Skip setup if Ollama already installed
5. **Module Control**: Clear one module, keep others

### For Developers:
1. **Easy Testing**: Reset data between test runs
2. **Clean Development**: Fresh workspace on demand
3. **Bug Reproduction**: Clear state to test clean install
4. **Demo Preparation**: Clear old data before demos
5. **Data Management**: Granular control over each module
